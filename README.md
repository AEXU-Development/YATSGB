/saveid - Save your Torn ID so others can view your battle stats

/stats - View IGN, level, battle stats, total stats, and Xanax used. Shows stat changes since your last check and indicates if any Xanax debuffs are active.

/total - Show contributors (names only) and the total combined stats across the server. Displays changes since the last check.

/limit - Restricts the bot's usage to specific channels (typically accessible only to trusted members). Can be used multiple times to add more channels.

/removelimit - Removes a limited channel. If no channels remain, the bot becomes usable server-wide again.

> If the bot is limited, new or untrusted members will need to save their ID via DMs with the bot.
