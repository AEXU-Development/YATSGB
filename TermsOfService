Terms of Service for YATSGB
Last Updated: 07/07/2025

By using YATSGB, you agree to these Terms of Service. If you do not agree, do not use the Bot.

1. Usage
You must comply with Discord's Terms of Service and Community Guidelines.
Do not use the Bot for illegal, harmful, or abusive purposes.
You must have proper authorization from the server owner or administrators to invite the Bot to a server.


2. Data Collection
The Bot may collect data such as Discord user IDs, server IDs, message content (if applicable), and commands used.
Data is used solely to provide bot functionality and assist with debugging. It is not shared with any third parties.
You can request data deletion by contacting axeysalt@gmail.com (Google LLC) or @aexu_ on Discord (Discord Inc.).


3. Availability
The Bot is provided "as is" with no guaranteed uptime or availability.
While I do my best to keep the Bot online and running most of the time, occasional downtime or interruptions may happen without prior notice since I manage it alone.
Features may change or be removed without notice.


4. Limitation of Liability
You use the Bot at your own risk.
I am not responsible for any damages or losses resulting from use or misuse of the Bot.


5. Termination
I reserve the right to ban users or remove the Bot from servers at my discretion, especially for violations of these terms.


6. Changes
I may update these Terms at any time. Continued use of the Bot after changes means acceptance of the new Terms.
